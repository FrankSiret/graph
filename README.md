# graph
Graph class using adjacency list for Data Structure II course, Universidad de Oriente, Cuba. 2019-2020.

All implementations use the STL (Standard Template Library).

The nodes start in 0 (0-index),

Maximum of nodes is 1000, if you want change it, then modify the class

Use c++11 or above

A lot of Implementations using the graph class created:
1. There is a path between two nodes
2. Is the Graph cyclic?
3. The minimum path between two nodes
4. Is the graph connected?
5. How many connected components does the graph have
6. Is a node in the graph articualtion point
7. How many articulation point and bridges there is in the graph
8. Is the graph biconnected?
9. Prim algorithm, know the minimun spanning tree
10. Kruskal algorithm, know the minimun spanning tree, with union-find disjoin-set algorithn
